              Customer Service
            </h3>
            <p className="text-md text-white pb-2">
              Concierge security officers are often positioned at the front
              entrance of client sites, meaning that our concierge officer is
              responsible for ensuring that clients and important visitors
              receive an outstanding first impression.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md text-white pb-2">
              As a result, we select and train our concierge security officers
              carefully to ensure that they are well-presented and have
              exceptional front-facing customer service and communication
              skills.

              a thorough understanding of security-specific software packages
              including Titan, Gallagher and Honeywell. This enables our
              security officers to problem solve and address security issues,
              set up security access for authorised persons and provide on-site
              expertise to authorised users.

              We understand that every business is different and may benefit
              from a different set of complementary skills within a concierge or
              site entry role.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md text-white pb-2">
              Two of the critical attributes which we require from our concierge
              and site entry security officers are an ability to adapt to
              different roles and a passion for ongoing learning and
              professional development.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md text-white pb-2">
              Accordingly, we are keen to work with clients to identify
              additional complementary skills and associated training
              opportunities which would be of value to both our clients and our
              security officers.
